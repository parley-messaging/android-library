## 3.5.0 - Released 2 May 2022

### Upgrading:

Parley now uses a unique device id per app installation as default setting.

**IMPORTANT**: When using anonymous chats, the chat now always starts empty after a new app installation by default.

_What's changed?_

- In Parley 3.4.5 and lower the Android `DEVICE_ID` was used as device id. This device id does not change per app installation, causing anonymous chats to continue with their existing chat even when the user deleted and reinstalled the app. 
- In Parley 3.5.0 and higher a random UUID is used as device id. This value is stored in the shared preferences by default and is generated once per installation. Updating the app won't result in a new device id as long as the cache isn't cleared. This ensures that new anonymous chats always start empty.

**Note**: This only affects the behavior of starting anonymous chats, chats that use the user authorization won't be affected by this change.

**Note**: This is the default behavior of Parley. When passing the device id to the configure method, Parley will use that as device id instead and won't store it in the shared preferences either.

### Changes:

- Device id is now unique per installation, instead of using the Android `DEVICE_ID`. Affects how anonymous chats are handled.
- Added optional `Parley.reset(callback)` method to reset Parley back to its initial state, clearing the user and chat data that is in memory.

## 3.4.5 - Released 7 Apr 2022

- Fixed a crash that could occur when returning to the app in case the ParleyView is being closed soon after opening.

## 3.4.4 - Released 25 Mar 2022

- Added optional `ParleyView.setLaunchCallback(launchCallback)` to support handling activity results directly inside a Fragment instead of the Activity. Check out the advanced steps in the [README.md](README.md). 

## 3.4.3 - Released 23 Mar 2022

- Compose input is now aligned centred compared to the send button.
- Fixed a crash when agent is typing.

## 3.4.2 - Released 11 Mar 2022

- Added optional `uniqueDeviceIdentifier` parameter to the configure method to override the default device identifier that Parley uses.
- Updated TouchImageView from version 2.2.0 to 3.1.1

## 3.4.1 - Released 20 Jan 2022

### Upgrading

- Add the `Parley.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);` method in the *Activity* that contains the *ParleyView* for a smooth interaction when Parley needs to request permissions. Check out the updated *Step 4* in [README.md](README.md#step-4-forward-activity-results).

### Changes:

- Request camera permission if needed 

## 3.4.0 - Released 15 Nov 2021

- Added option to configure where the notifications should be shown in the chat: `top` (default) or `bottom`.
  For example: to show them on the bottom:
  
  Override the value `parley_notifications_position`:
  ```xml
  <item name="parley_notifications_position" type="integer">bottom</item>
  ```

  Or programmatically by calling:
  ```java
  parleyView.setNotificationsPosition(ParleyPosition.Vertical.BOTTOM);
  ```
- Fixed a small animation issue with quick replies.

## 3.3.0 - Released 13 Oct 2021

### Upgrading:

Parley now uses the latest stable API version by default, which is now V1.6. In addition to this, an `apiVersion` field has been added to `ParleyNetwork` to be able to override this with a lower version. Along with this change, deprecating the methods that do not configure the API version.

- **DEPRECATION**: `ParleyNetwork(String url, String path, @XmlRes Integer securityConfigResourceFile)` is now deprecated, use `ParleyNetwork(String, String, ApiVersion, Integer)` instead.
- **DEPRECATION**: `ParleyNetwork(String url, String path, @XmlRes Integer securityConfigResourceFile, Map<String, String> headers)` is now deprecated, use `ParleyNetwork(String, String, ApiVersion, Integer, Map)` instead.

### Changes:

- Added `ApiVersion` parameter to ParleyNetwork to define the API version used. By default Parley uses the latest stable version.
- Added support for the Parley API V1.6 with the new media handling. When using API V1.2, the old method is being used.

```xml
<trustkit-config enforcePinning="true"/>

  - *Additions (styling)*: Properties that are available for agent messages for the items that exist in the carousel, can be overridden by using the property named with `carousel` in it
